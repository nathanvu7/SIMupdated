Hello!
  This is the Unity files for the Toronto Metropolitan University BattleBots Team's Simulation Platform.
  Version Alpha (v0.2)
  - Visualization of Visual Cones,
  - Implementation of State Machine for Automation: Search, Track, Attack, Idle
  - Simple movement, controls, and Displays.
V0.2: This version was developed for TMU March's Open House Engineering Expo, where we had a lot of students come and play our demo! It was really fun!
  - Health and Damage System!
  - Play against another Player, or against AI
  - Controller support! Fixed up the control systems!
  - New HUD elements, Main Menu, and Scoring System!


  Combat robotics, more affectionately known internally as BattleBots (from the hit TV series), is a genre of engineering competitions formed around designing and operating robots to fight in an arena.
Competitors come from all around the world, ranging from young hobbyists starting with prebuilt kits to full engineering teams operating 150lb machines. And of course, plenty of  engineering students looking to take on a challenge.
For TMU, we wanted to bring something exciting and novel to the competitive combat robotics scene by exploring possible automation and AI implementations using computer vision. In order to do so, we must first create a platform to explore, develop and test these processes in a simulated environment. Naturally, this first draft (v0.1) is nowhere near its full potential, but it's a start. Furthermore, we also wanted to have an exciting marketing hook for curious spectators and potential sponsors. The idea for a videogame that can be played on our website or Itch.io was incredibly exciting for me personally since I - like many aspiring modern software developers - dream of working on videogames.
  
  I hope you enjoy!
